    "NoSQL databases, and in particular, graph databases like Neo4J help us analyze business problems in new and exciting ways. While a SQL database could be used to solve some of these problems, it would involve a significant amount of supplemental analysis code that a graph database solves rapidly and more naturally. In particular, graph databases are very effective in analyzing network and route problems. We can use a graph database to answer our questions about how to best leverage existing BART infrastructure to deliver meals.  Therefore, we will combine our OLTP SQL database with the analytical power of a Neo4j graph database to demonstrate how we can help make AGMs strategic vision come to life!\n",
